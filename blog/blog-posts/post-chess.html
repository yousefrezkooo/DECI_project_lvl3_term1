            <h1>♟️ Life is Chess, Every Move Matters</h1>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>Life isn't a game of memorization—like a pre-planned chess match.</p>
                <p>True mastery comes from understanding where you are and making bold, creative moves.</p>
                <p>I don't just follow the game—I shape it.</p>
                <p>Life, like chess, is unpredictable. Every choice we make shapes our path.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lessons">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Take Your Time</h3>
                        <p>Rushing can lead to mistakes. In life, like in chess, sometimes the best move is to stop and think before acting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Learn from Losses</h3>
                        <p>Even the best players lose. Failure isn't the end—it's a chance to reflect and grow.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Control Your Emotions</h3>
                        <p>Whether in chess or life, letting emotions control you can lead to mistakes. Stay calm, and think clearly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Know When to Rest</h3>
                        <p>If you're burned out, take a break. Pushing through when you're tired only leads to more mistakes. Rest, recharge, and come back stronger.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Ego vs. Growth</h3>
                        <p>Wins feel great, but losses teach us humility. Every experience, good or bad, is part of learning and improving.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Life and chess are about balance—acting when needed, reflecting when necessary, and always growing.</p>
